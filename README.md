# PREDICT453_CaseStudy2
A place to put code and other material used in Case Study 2 from Cohort 8 of PREDICT 453 with Dr. Maren.

# DSI
This is a directory where all of the .txt versions of the DSI's in the full corpus live.  Currently, this is only missing DSI 38 and DSI 40.

# RTV
The RTV file currently only represents exact noun phrases that were proposed in the RTV.  This file does not include concepts or terms related to these as equivalence classes.

# Note
This isn't an official thing, it's just something I created to keep track of what I was using and make it easier to share. :) . Thanks for looking! --Anna
